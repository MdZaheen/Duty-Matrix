## Key Algorithms and Business Logic

### 1. Professor Allocation Algorithm
The professor allocation algorithm (`professorAllocator.ts`) uses the following approach:
1. Fetches all professors ordered by duty count (ascending)
2. Fetches all active rooms
3. Determines the required number of professors based on rooms and relief needs
4. Selects professors with the lowest duty counts
5. Assigns professors to rooms in a balanced manner
6. Assigns relief professors as needed
7. Updates professor duty counts

```typescript
// Simplified pseudocode for professor allocation
function allocateProfessors(scheduleId) {
  const professors = await getProfessorsSortedByDutyCount();
  const rooms = await getActiveRooms();
  const requiredProfessors = rooms.length + calculateReliefCount(rooms.length);
  
  if (professors.length < requiredProfessors) {
    return error("Not enough professors");
  }
  
  const selectedProfessors = professors.slice(0, requiredProfessors);
  
  // Assign main duty professors
  rooms.forEach((room, index) => {
    allocations.push({
      professor: selectedProfessors[index]._id,
      room: room._id,
      schedule: scheduleId,
      isReliever: false
    });
  });
  
  // Assign relievers
  for (let i = rooms.length; i < requiredProfessors; i++) {
    allocations.push({
      professor: selectedProfessors[i]._id,
      schedule: scheduleId,
      isReliever: true
    });
  }
  
  // Update duty counts and save allocations
  await saveDutyAllocations(allocations);
  await updateProfessorDutyCounts(selectedProfessors);
  
  return { success: true, allocations };
}
```

### 2. Student Allocation Algorithm
#### Standard Section-wise Allocation
The standard student allocation algorithm (`studentAllocator.ts:allocateStudents`) follows this approach:
1. Groups students by section
2. Allocates entire sections to rooms when possible
3. Splits sections across rooms if needed
4. Assigns seat numbers sequentially
5. Optimizes room usage by starting with the largest rooms

```typescript
// Simplified pseudocode for section-wise student allocation
function allocateStudents(scheduleId, subjectId) {
  const students = await getStudentsBySubject(subjectId);
  const rooms = await getRoomsSortedByCapacity();
  const sections = groupStudentsBySection(students);
  
  let currentRoom = rooms[0];
  let currentSeat = 1;
  
  // Process each section
  for (const section of sections) {
    // Try to fit section in current room
    if (canFitInRoom(section.students, currentRoom, currentSeat)) {
      allocateStudentsToRoom(section.students, currentRoom, currentSeat);
      currentSeat += section.students.length;
    } else {
      // Split section across rooms
      splitSectionAcrossRooms(section.students, rooms, currentSeat);
    }
  }
  
  return { success: true, allocations };
}
```
